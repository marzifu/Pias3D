# The Problem
I've always wanted to make and/or source my own Voron and the likes. But the main problem I kept facing is the unimaginably expensive kits that are being sold here in Indonesia, or just the shipment cost + tax that doesn't make sense for me to pay.

Other than that the cost of basically the cheapest CoreXY is around $800 USD _my hopes and dreams_.

# The Solution?
I learnt how to use FreeCAD to draw up my hilariously bad designs until I came to this rendition of the machine which I called Pias. _fancy~_

But no, the name just suggest the eternal loop of fixing, upgrading, maintenance, and what not. Which is what I want to minimize by creating a "proper" machine.

So after scouring countless builds of 3D printers, anything from Rolohaun's build, Mikhail Design's build, and Voron's. I decided to find parts that is easily found here, and thus decided to design a machine around the parts that I find. With the main focus of:

### 1) Keeping It Affordable
The reason this is the main focus is because, good 3D printers are expensiveâ€” Even more so for CoreXY systems (Usually an additional $200-$300 _yikes_).

So with that I tried to find hardwares that are a good start, but could be upgraded along the way. Because the important part is for you (and me) as a hobbyist, to be able to build a machine.

### 2) Ease of Procurement
I know this is different to everyone, but my main goal for now is to make a machine that could easily be built by anyone with what we have (Importing's out of the question for us, _unless you have a wae_, in which I dont).

Though there are some Mellow parts that are being sold, the parts are almost 5x of some generic ones. You can get those parts sure, but for the sake of keeping my wallet not empty I am crossing that.

### 3) Upgrade and Update
My first experience with troubleshooting a printer is with a Kingroon KP3S Pro V2, which wasn't fun. I had to replace the mainboard two times, and then ended up switching to a BTT board which is going great.

Tinkering is not fun, if its undocumented and you can reach no one. With that the plan is to document every single upgrades, and update this repository for future builds. It could be some loose fits, or even some arbitrary auxiliary stuff, but documentations are crucial for the longevity of this project.

# Changelogs
### 04/25/2025
Finally back to maintaining this repository after I actually finished the 4th? 6th? rendition of this project. The basic idea of selling it is still in mind, but right not he focus is to have a proper prototype build that could work to print virtually any "normal" material eg. PETG, ABS, ASA, TPU.

I'll try to make a comprehensive build guide, but I do not know how to make a guide like how Voron/Annex which is what I strive for. It's going to be scuffed, but please bear with me.

The next update on this log would probably be an update by creating BOM and pricing in IDR (Indonesian Rupiah), and then converting it to dollars and then saving the links somewhere.
Cheers to this project!
